The average regular-season BA across the thirty MLB teams in the 2014 season was 0.251 \cite{SportsReferenceBatting:2015}.  A rule of thumb in selecting batters is to look for BA values above 0.250---that is, we look for batters who get a hit about one in every four at bats. Hitters batting above 0.300 are rare.

\item[check swing] \index{baseball term!check swing} A batter begins to swing at a pitched ball, but not far enough to be called a strike.  Whether a batter's swing is a check swing or a strike swinging is a matter of judgment.

Having a defensive player on every base is covering the bases.

\item[cut-off position] \index{baseball term!cut-off position} A position on the field of play between an outfielder and home plate. With a runner rounding the bases and heading for home, the outfielder can throw a ball toward home plate using a low trajectory, so  an infielder in the cut-off position can intercept the ball and throw to another base, usually second base, to prevent another runner from advancing around the bases. Alternatively, the infielder cutting off the ball from the outfield can decide to throw the ball home 
enabling the catcher to tag the runner out.
Because the infielder is closer to home base than the outfielder, the infielder's throw is likely to be more accurate than the outfielder's. Many outfielders do not have strong throws to home base, so throwing to the player in the cut-off position is essential. 


\item[dead ball]\index{baseball term!dead ball} Ball out of play, resulting in temporary suspension of play.

\item[dead ball era]\index{baseball term!dead ball era} Pre-1920 baseball. Period during which very few balls were used during games. There was no requirement to use a new white ball. Contrasted with \emph{live ball era}.

\item[defensive indifference]\index{baseball term!defensive indifference} A runner on base attempts to take the next base, and the team on the field allows it. The situation occurs late in a game when the team on the field has a lead of more than one run, so an additional run by the hitting team will not win the game. When the official scorer rules defensive indifference, the runner's act of taking the next base is not recorded as a stolen base.

\item[designated hitter (DH)]\index{baseball term!designated hitter (DH)} A player who has a place in the batting order but does not play a position in the field. This player hits in place of the weakest hitting player who takes the field (usually the pitcher). In Major League Baseball, the designated hitter role may be used in the American League, but not the National League.

The computation is based on historical play-by-play data for the state or game situation.

As long as the second baseman's foot is in the neighborhood of second base, the force out is recorded. This is to avoid injuries to the players who are wearing spikes on their shoes. See \emph{force out}.

\item[no hitter]\index{baseball term!no hitter} Pitcher pitches nine innings  without allowing a hit, although batters may reach base through walks or errors. Also see \emph{perfect game}.

\item[no-no]\index{baseball term!no-no} Baseball slang for a no hitter. Think in terms of no hits and no runs scored by the other team. Also see \emph{perfect game}.


\item[obstruction] \index{baseball term!obstruction} A fielder impeding the progress of a runner while not in possession of the ball.

\item[offense]\index{baseball term!offense} Team up to bat, as opposed to the team that in the field (defense).

\item[official scorer]\index{baseball term!official scorer} Person designated to keep records of the game and make decisions about hits versus fielding errors.

\item[on the field (team)]\index{baseball term!on the field (team)} The team on the field is the team playing defense, as opposed to the batting team.

\item[on-base percentage (OBP)]\index{baseball term!on-base percentage (OBP)} Proportion of plate appearances in which a batter reaches base through a hit, walk, or hit by pitch. Does not include reaching base by a fielding error, fielder's choice, dropped/uncaught third strike, fielder's obstruction, or catcher's interference. Also called on-base average (OBA). Usually presented as a proportion, not a percentage.  Popularized by the \citeN{Lewis:2003} book \emph{Moneyball} and the subsequent movie by the same name, OBP is seen as a better index of offensive performance than batting average. Computed as 
$$OBP = {(Hits + Walks + Hit \hspace*{.03in} by \hspace*{.03in} Pitch)\over(At \hspace*{.03in} Bats + Walks + Hit \hspace*{.03in} by \hspace*{.03in} Pitch + Sacrifices)}$$
Getting a walk or being hit by a pitch has the same effect as a base hit for the batter himself---they move the batter to first base without an out being recorded.  The average regular-season OBP across the thirty MLB teams in the 2014 season was 0.314 \cite{SportsReferenceBatting:2015}.  A rule of thumb in selecting good batters is to look for OBP values above 0.333---that is, we look for batters who get on base about one in every three plate appearances.

\item[on-base percentage plus slugging (OPS)]\index{on-base  percentage plus slugging (OPS)} Measure of overall hitting prowess. $$OPS = OBP + SLG$$ The average regular-season OPS across the thirty MLB teams in the 2014 season was 0.700 \cite{SportsReferenceBatting:2015}.   

\item[open batting stance]\index{baseball term!open batting stance} A batter's position in the batter's box in which the foot closest to the pitcher is further away from home plate than the foot farthest from the pitcher.

\item[``out'']\index{baseball term!``out''}  Umpire call indicating that an out is to be recorded.

\item[outfielder]\index{baseball term!outfielder} Defensive player who plays far away from the bases.

\item[overslide]\index{baseball term!overslide} At second or third base, a runner can, after touching the base, go beyond the base and lose contact with the base. When the player loses contact with the base, he may be tagged out by a fielder. An overslide can occur at second and third base.  An overslide is not relevant at first base where running beyond the base and toward foul territory is permitted. An overslide is not relevant at home base, where running beyond home base after scoring a run completes the runner's path around the bases.

\item[pace of play]\index{baseball term!pace of play} Also called \emph{pace of game}. Major League Baseball has been experimenting with ways to speed up the game, focusing on unnecessary delays by pitchers or batters. This is controversial because  the leisurely pace and lack of a time clock are attractions of baseball.  The introduction of video replay affects pace of play, making games longer.

\item[passed ball]\index{baseball term!passed ball} Pitch that gets past the catcher that is the fault of the catcher, as opposed to a wild pitch, which is the fault of the pitcher.

\item[PECOTA]\index{baseball term!PECOTA} A measurement and prediction system that uses player-comparable age curves as its base data. The name refers to Bill Pecota, a Kansas City Royals infielder from the 1980s.

\item[perfect game]\index{baseball term!perfect game} Pitcher pitches nine innings  without allowing a runner to reach base---no hits, no walks, no errors.  Twenty-seven batters come to the plate, and they all make outs.

\item[pick off assignment]\index{baseball term!pick off assignment}  Designation of the fielder responsible for covering the bag for a pick off play. Relevant to pick offs at second base, where either the second baseman or the shortstop could cover the bag.

\item[pick off play]\index{baseball term!pick off play}  A pitcher throws to first, second, or third base in an attempt to catch a runner off base. The fielder receiving the ball must tag the runner out before the runner touches a base. Most commonly executed with a runner at first base.

\item[pitch] \index{baseball term!pitch}  Ball delivered by the pitcher to the batter.

\item[pitch count] \index{baseball term!pitch count}  The number of pitches (balls plus strikes) thrown by a pitcher after his entry into a game. This number is watched carefully by managers. A starting pitcher's pitch count of one hundred is seen as a warning signal by many managers. With higher pitch counts, pitchers are more susceptible to injuries.  At higher pitch counts, a pitcher's fastball velocity is reduced. The pitcher is less effective in getting outs.  
Pitch count also refers to the number of pitches that a batter has faced in a given at-bat.  The offensive team may employ a high-pitch-count strategy, attempting to take more pitches (balls and strikes) to drive up the starting pitcher's pitch count, thus forcing that pitcher out of the game. 
This was one of the strategies popularized by the \citeN{Lewis:2003} book \emph{Moneyball} and the subsequent movie by the same name.

\item[pitcher's park] \index{baseball term!pitcher's park} Parks such as U.S. Cellular Field in Chicago and AT\&T Park in San Francisco are known to be favorable to pitchers, yielding lower expected runs across all in-game states. As opposed to a \emph{hitter's park}.


\item[pitcher's plate] \index{baseball term!pitcher's plate}  A rectangular hard rubber platform near the middle of the pitcher's mound.  The pitcher's pivot foot must be on the pitcher's plate prior to delivering the ball to the batter.   Also called the \emph{rubber}.

\item[pitching from the stretch]\index{baseball term!pitching from the stretch} Instead of using a full windup, the pitcher uses a partial windup, coming to a full stop before throwing. Typically used when there is a runner on base.

\item[pitching depth]\index{baseball term!pitching depth} Number of pitchers a team has available for a game.

\item[pitching mound] \index{baseball term!pitching mound}  Raised circular area from which the pitcher pitches.


\item[pitching rotation] \index{baseball term!pitching rotation}  The ordered set of four or five players that a team uses as its starting pitchers.

\item[pivot foot]\index{baseball term!pivot foot} Pitcher's foot that must be in contact with the pitcher's plate when delivering the ball to the batter.

\item[place hitter] \index{baseball term!place hitter}  Hitter who controls the bat so well as to place the ball where no fielders can get to it, while keeping the ball in the park.

\item[plate]\index{baseball term!plate} Baseball slang verb for scoring a run. Comes from the term ``home plate.''  So ``they plate two'' means ``they score two runs.''

\item[plate appearance]\index{baseball term!plate appearance} Sum of at bats, walks, hit by pitches and sacrifices. 
$$Plate  \hspace*{.03in} Apperances = At \hspace*{.03in} Bats + Walks + Hit \hspace*{.03in} by \hspace*{.03in} Pitch + Sacrifices$$

\item[platooning] \index{baseball term!platooning} A managerial strategy in which different lineups are used when facing right-handed versus left-handed pitchers.  For example, the lineup may include more right-handed hitters when the starting pitcher of the opposing team is left-handed and more left-handed hitters when the starting pitcher of the opposing team is right-handed.  This is done because right-handed hitters are expected to be less effective against right-handed pitchers and left-handed hitters are expected to be less effective against left-handed pitchers. These differences in effectiveness are due to the fact that a curve ball breaks away from a like-handed hitter, making it harder to hit.

\item[``play ball'']\index{baseball term!``play ball''} Umpire-in-chief's order to begin the game.

\item[pop-up] \index{baseball term!pop-up} Ball hit in the air that does not travel far. Usually caught by an infielder, catcher, or pitcher.

\item[set position]\index{baseball term!set position} Legal pitching position usually used when  offensive players are on base. In the set position, the pitcher comes to a complete stop prior to throwing the ball. The other legal position is the \emph{windup position.}  Also see \emph{balk}.

\item[shadow ball] \index{baseball term!shadow ball} Baseball pantomime or playing with an imaginary ball to entertain fans. Popularized in the black baseball teams during the depression.

\item[shift]\index{baseball term!shift} On-the-field players playing out of position to adjust to the particular strengths of the hitter.  For a right-handed pull hitter, for example, a shift may involve the second baseman playing between second base and third base, instead of in his normal position between second base and first base.  The use of the shift is controversial. Fielders playing away from their normal positions may be less proficient in making double plays, executing pick offs, and taking cut-off positions. The shift also affects the integrity of baseball data. Suppose a third baseman is in a shift, playing between first base and second base with a left-handed pull hitter at bat. When that third baseman fields a ground ball between first and second base, throwing the batter out at first, the play is recorded as a 5-3 put out, implying that the ball was hit toward third base.  

\item[shine ball] \index{baseball term!shine ball} The pitcher rubs the ball clean on one side using his uniform, while applying dirt or powder on the other side. Employed to affect the ball's trajectory.

\item[shutout] \index{baseball term!shutout}  A complete nine-inning game thrown by one pitcher with no runs scored by the opposing team..

\item[slider] \index{baseball term!slider} A ball gripped like a two-seam fastball, but slightly off-center. With MLB speeds 70--85 mph, it is not as fast as a fastball but breaks in the same direction as a curveball.

\item[slugging percentage (SLG)]\index{baseball term!slugging percentage (SLG)} Measure of hitting power.  Babe Ruth's slugging percentage was 0.690, the MLB all-time record. The maximum value possible is 4.0, implying that a player hits a home run in every at bat.  Computed as 
$$SLG = {{(Singles + (2 \times Doubles) + (3 \times Triples) + (4 \times Home  \hspace*{.03in} Runs)}\over{At \hspace*{.03in} Bats}}$$
The average regular-season SLG across the thirty MLB teams in the 2014 season was 0.386 \cite{SportsReferenceBatting:2015}.  


\item[small ball] \index{baseball term!small ball}  Baseball strategy based on base hits, walks, and stolen bases. That is, runs are scored by advancing by one base at a time---manufactured runs. Also called an \emph{inside game}, suggesting that the action is inside the base paths.


\item[spin rate] \index{baseball term!spin rate}  The rate of a pitched ball's spin on its way from the pitcher's hand to home plate.  Fastballs with the same speed in miles per hour may have very different spin rates. Fastballs with low spin rates (fewer than 2,000 revolutions per minute) are sometimes called ``heavy.'' They appear to sink.  Fastballs with high spin rates (more than 2,500 revolutions per minute) have more movement.




\item[spitball] \index{baseball term!spitball} Also called a \emph{spitter}.  The pitcher applies saliva or some foreign substance to the ball, which may affect the ball's trajectory. Spitballs are not allowed in Major League Baseball, although some pitchers have been suspected of throwing spitballs.

With a \emph{suicide squeeze}, the runner on third begins running home as the pitcher begins to throw the ball. With a \emph{safety squeeze}, the runner on third begins running after the batter bunts the ball.

\item[starting pitcher] \index{baseball term!starting pitcher} The pitcher who is in the starting line-up for a game, as opposed to a relief pitcher.

\item[steal (stolen base, SB)]\index{baseball term!steal (stolen base, SB)} Advancing from first to second base, second to third, or third to home without the assistance of a hit, passed ball, or wild pitch.

Or, on a third strike, a ball that the batter swings at and hits foul directly into the catcher's glove or hand, which is also known as a \emph{foul tip}. Or, on an attempted bunt on the third strike, a bunt that is hit outside the foul lines is a strike swinging.  For keeping a complete record of balls and strikes, any ball that is put into play (regardless of its position in the strike zone) is counted as a strike.

\item[strikeout (K)] \index{baseball term!strikeout (K)}  A batter gets three strikes before getting four balls. Can be a  \emph{strikeout looking} or \emph{called strike three} with the batter not swinging at the ball or a \emph{strikeout swinging}. The symbol \emph{K} represents a strikeout and may be thought of as coming from the word ``knockout'' or from the letter ``k'' in ``strikeout.''  The \emph{K} is sometimes written backwards to indicate a strikeout looking.  If first base is unoccupied by a runner and the catcher fails to catch the third strike, then the batter can be granted first base if he reaches that base before being forced out. The symbol \emph{SO} is used to represent a strikeout or the number of strikeouts by a batter.  

\item[strike zone] \index{baseball term!strike zone}  Rectangular region with its base width and depth defined by the area of home plate and its height defined by reference to the batter, extending from the batter's kneecap to approximately three baseballs above the batter's belt. Formerly, the upper range of the strike zone was the batter's shoulders. The effective strike zone varies from one umpire to the next. A smaller or narrow strike zone favors the batter. A larger or wide strike zone favors the pitcher.  Baseball analysts measure the size of the strike zone by area in square feet. 


\item[suspended game]\index{baseball term!suspended game} A called game to be completed at a later time/date.

Upon tagging up in this way, the runner will be granted the next base if he is not tagged out by a fielder prior to touching the next base.

\item[tag out]\index{baseball term!tag out} As opposed to a \emph{force out}, an out recorded for a runner by tagging him with the ball or glove containing the ball before the runner can touch the base.  Also called a  \emph{tag play}.

See \emph{holding runner on base}.

\item[take a pitcher deep]\index{baseball term!take a pitcher deep} Baseball slang for hitting a home run.

\item[Texas Leaguer]\index{baseball term!Texas Leaguer} Term used for a ball that falls for a hit between the infielders and the outfielders. Also called a ``bloop single.'' The Texas League is a Double-A minor league baseball league, but there is no evidence that this type of hit is any more prevalent in that league than in any other league.

\item[third base]\index{baseball term!third base} The base after first and second base that a runner must touch on his way to home plate to score a run.

\item[tip a pitch] \index{baseball term!tip a pitch}  An action by the pitcher that reveals the type of pitch that is being thrown. This could be the pitcher's position on the pitcher's plate (rubber), arm angle, or release point. If any of these varies with the type of pitch, an astute batter may be able to make an inference about the type of pitch being thrown.  Knowing the type of pitch that is being thrown gives the batter an advantage in hitting.

\item[total bases (TB)] \index{baseball term!total bases (TB)}  The number of bases a player gains as a result of hits.  That is, the number of singles, plus two times the number of doubles, three times the number of triples, and four times the number of home runs.

\item[umpire-in-chief]\index{baseball term!umpire-in-chief} Lead umpire of the umpiring crew.

\item[up the middle]\index{baseball term!up the middle} Sound defense up the middle refers to the play of the middle infielders (second baseman and shortstop) and the center fielder.

A WAR value of 5, say, means that the team will win five fewer runs across the entire season if it has to replace the player.
Expressed in units of wins across the season, with ten runs being equivalent to one win. Various proprietary versions of this measure exist, one variation being wins above replacement player (WARP). WAR is a summary performance measure similar to \emph{VORP}.  The measure \emph{openWAR} represents an open-source measure of WAR, which permits calculation from public-domain data sources. 

\item[WHIP] \index{baseball term!WHIP} Walks and hits allowed per inning pitched. Like earned run average (ERA), a summary measure of pitching performance.
